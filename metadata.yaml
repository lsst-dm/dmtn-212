description: "The Rubin Science Platform (RSP) is a collection of services intended to provide the Rubin scientific community with \"next-to-the-data\" exploration and analysis capabilities. It refers to the major three user-facing aspects (Portal, Notebook, API) as well as the infrastructure services that support them.  Core user-facing services, infrastructure services as well as \"guest\" services all make use of a single cloud-native deployment infrastructure. 

This document describes the RSP system architecture, key technical decisions, a description of user-facing and supporting services, an explanation of the deployment infrastructure, and an outline of current operational environments. 

This is a live document describing existing capabilities as they are currently available as our system is continuously evolved to meet its design requirements as well as address future technical challenges and emerging user needs."
